# MOVIE-BOOKING-APPLICATION

I built the application using React, Node.js, Express, Redux, MongoDB, and deployed it with a DevOps architecture included Docker.

This application is designed to provide a seamless user experience while offering full functionality. Users can easily book and cancel their bookings through their user profile, which helps them keep track of their bookings. Meanwhile, the admin can add new movies for booking availability for users through an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that ensures a great user experience.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:-

React (Framework),
 Node (Backend),
 MongoDb (DataBase),
 Redux (State Management),
 Docker (Containerization)
